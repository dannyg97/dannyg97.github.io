                Hey there! My name is Danny and I'm one trimester away from earning my degree at UNSW with a Bachelor of
                Computer Science. My university experience with software development, as well as my extracurricular
                activities involving hackathons and project management, has given me a strong starting skill set for the
                software development industry. My passion in this field has led me to seek out learning opportunities in
                all
                facets of computer science, with a particular interest in full stack application development.
                <br><br>
                I previously taught for <a href="https://bitbybiteducation.com.au/">BitByBit</a> where I taught Python to junior
                high schoolers. Later on in the role, I also taught basic web development fundamentals, including HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. I've recently finished an internship as a Full Stack Developer with <a href="https://www.geckoonline.com.au/">Gecko</a>, 
                where I implemented quality of life functionality for customers, and acquired applied experience working in an agile environment.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I'm laser focused on learning React and NodeJS to create dynamic web pages. I've recently finished a chat 
                application, although I'm planning on building on top of it to craft a multiplayer table-top game using the same logic for 
                user-to-user communication.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not coding, you'll likely catch me bouldering, hiking around the Blue Mountains, or brushing up on my drawing skills!

                    A web scraper that uses a Python API wrapper for Discord to create a rest API that conforms to the

                    article; the web scraper uses BS4 to extract relevant key metrics from wiki pages.

                    personal skillset. Utilises Bootstrap4 to improve design and layout of the webpage, as well as

                    Worked as the main UX designer for a cross-platform mobile application that focuses on the tracking
                    and improvement of mental health. Served as my introduction to mobile application development (which
                    I ended up finding super fun), and also served as an introduction to proper Agile methodologies
                    (scrums, taskboards, user stories, etc). 
                    <br>
                    Used Flutter's widget-centric devkit to develop the application.
